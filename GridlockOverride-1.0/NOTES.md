# GridlockOverride


OVERVIEW:

This is a Java based third person shooter game, that is multiplayer. This was developed using Processing. 
The idea behind this game is to give a quick and easy platform like agario, but with more advanced mechanics and player interactions. 
You play as a ship that has to solve a maze while simultaneous fighting off other players. The key to success will be team work above all else, because the game won't allow it any other way.

ISSUES:
-The map rendering still needs work, the maps do not spawn exactly how I could like them to, they don't form more intricate pathways.
-The portal sometimes spawns ontop of other boxes making maps beatable
-Mulitplayer integration still is not set up
-Ship needs to be redesigned and have the ability to turn
-Camera does not support rotation and remains fixed
-The map spawns ontop of level text sometimes
-Map boundaries could be fixed up
-Many features have been commented out because multiplayer features are not ready yet. (Release in Patch 1.1)
-Random glitch when you escape shark attack, sometimes it starts the level over
